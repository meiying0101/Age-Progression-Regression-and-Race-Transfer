# Age-Progression-Regression-and-Race-Transfer

## Abstract

We want to predict of future looks and estimate of previous looks, also referred to as face aging and rejuvenation, aims to render face images with or without the "aging" effect but still preserve personal features of the face. It has tremendous impact to a wide-range of applications, e.g., face prediction of wanted/missing person, age-invariant verification, entertainment, etc. The rapid development of generative adversarial networks (GANs) has shown impressive results in face image generation. We implement a conditional adversarial autoencoder (CAAE) network to learn the face feature transformation and manifold \cite{zhifei2017cvpr}. In addition, we construct the network in race transfer application. Experimental results demonstrate the appealing performance and flexibility of the proposed framework.
